## Setup and Installation

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* JDK 21 or higher.
* Apache Maven 3.8 or higher.
* A running instance of a MySQL server.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd moviefliex
    ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
    In the project's root directory, create a new file named `.env`. This file is used to store sensitive credentials securely, separate from the source code.

3. **Populate the `.env` file:**
    Copy the template below into your `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your local MySQL database credentials.
    ```dotenv
    DATABASE_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/moviefliex_db
    DATABASE_USERNAME=your_mysql_user
    DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
    ```
    *Note: Please ensure the `moviefliex_db` database schema exists in your MySQL instance before running the application.*

4. **Build the Project:**
    Use the Maven Wrapper to compile the project and download all necessary dependencies.
    ```powershell
    # On Windows (PowerShell)
    .\mvnw.cmd clean install

    # On Linux/macOS
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```

## Running the Application

Once the project has been successfully built, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
# On Windows (PowerShell)
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

# On Linux/macOS
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
The API will start and be available at http://localhost:8080.

## API Documentation

The interactive API documentation, powered by **Swagger UI**, is available once the application is running. It provides a detailed overview of all available endpoints and allows for direct interaction with the API.

- **Swagger UI URL:** [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)  
- **OpenAPI 3.0 JSON URL:** [http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs)

In the Swagger UI, you can click the **"Authorize"** button and paste a **JWT** (obtained from the login endpoint) to test the protected routes directly in your browser.
